# Main style guide

This project is driven by fellow students and faculty to create entry point for any situation where you might get stuck or might forget something.

We try to adhere to a couple of style guidelines to make it easily comprehensibly. 
* Check lists should be a maximum of one page long. Longer check lists should be broken up into multiple checklist's.
* Detailed explanation of how to do something or who to contact at Cornell should go into the appendix. The appendix doesn't have to be in the list format.
